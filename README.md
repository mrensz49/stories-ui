When you read an online story, you're not just reading it on your own. You're joining a community of readers and authors who are passionate about stories. You can share your thoughts on the story with other readers, and you can even leave comments for the story.

## Preview

**[View Live Preview](https://storiesforyou.net/)**

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Clone the source files of the theme and navigate into the theme's root directory. Run `yarn` and then run `yarn dev`
which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live
reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `package.json` file to see which scripts are included.

#### Scripts
We have now switched to the Vite build tool, which is much faster.

- `yarn dev` start a vite dev server
- `yarn build` build all file to `dist`
